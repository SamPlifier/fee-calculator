"You will be given an HTML and CSS file - **you may not edit either of these files.** You will practice creating functions, working with variables and operators, and using conditionals. Additionally, you will begin to practice development in pairs (commonly called "pair programming") to see the benefits of having two sets of eyes on a piece of code!"
